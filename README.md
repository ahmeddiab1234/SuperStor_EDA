# Superstore Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Superstore Dataset. The dataset contains sales, profit, and other related information for a fictional superstore. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into the store's performance, identify trends, and understand the relationships between different features such as sales, profit, categories, regions, and customer segments.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis is named `Sample - Superstore.csv`. It contains 21 columns and 9994 rows, with each row representing a transaction or order. The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Order Date**: The date when the order was placed.
- **Ship Date**: The date when the order was shipped.
- **Ship Mode**: The mode of shipment (e.g., Standard Class, Second Class).
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
- **Segment**: The segment to which the customer belongs (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).
- **Country**: Country of the customer.
- **City**: City of the customer.
- **State**: State of the customer.
- **Postal Code**: Postal code of the customer.
- **Region**: Region where the customer is located.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Category**: Category of the product (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies).
- **Sub-Category**: Sub-category of the product (e.g., Chairs, Tables).
- **Product Name**: Name of the product.
- **Sales**: Sales amount for the product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product ordered.
- **Discount**: Discount applied to the product.
- **Profit**: Profit or loss incurred from the sale.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:

- **Introduction**: Brief overview of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.
- **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: Loading the dataset and performing initial inspections such as checking the shape, data types, and summary statistics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and converting data types where necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features such as sales, profit, and discount.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different features, such as sales vs. profit, and sales by region.
  - **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing sales and profit trends over time.
  - **Categorical Analysis**: Exploring the distribution of sales and profit across different categories and sub-categories.
  - **Visualizations**: Using matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations that help in understanding the data better.
- **Insights and Conclusions**: Summarizing the key findings from the analysis and providing actionable insights.

## Key Insights
- **Sales and Profit Trends**: The analysis reveals that certain categories and sub-categories contribute more to the overall sales and profit. For example, the Technology category tends to have higher sales and profit margins compared to Furniture.
- **Regional Performance**: The West region generates the highest sales and profit, while the Central region lags behind.
- **Discount Impact**: Higher discounts do not always lead to higher profits. In some cases, excessive discounts can lead to losses.
- **Customer Segments**: The Consumer segment contributes the most to sales, while the Corporate segment has a higher average profit per order.
